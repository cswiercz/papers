abstract = {Smale's alpha-theory uses estimates related to the convergence of Newton's method to give criteria implying that Newton iterations will converge quadratically to solutions to a square polynomial system. The program alphaCertified implements algorithms based on alpha-theory to certify solutions to polynomial systems using both exact rational arithmetic and arbitrary precision floating point arithmetic. It also implements an algorithm to certify whether a given point corresponds to a real solution to a real polynomial system, as well as algorithms to heuristically validate solutions to overdetermined systems. Examples are presented to demonstrate the algorithms.},

abstract = {Smale's alpha-theory certifies that Newton iterations will converge quadratically to a solution of a square system of analytic functions based on the Newton residual and all higher order derivatives at the given point. Shub and Smale presented a bound for the higher order derivatives of a system of polynomial equations based in part on the degrees of the equations. For a given system of polynomial-exponential equations, we consider a related system of polynomial-exponential equations and provide a bound on the higher order derivatives of this related system. This bound yields a complete algorithm for certifying solutions to polynomial-exponential systems, which is implemented in alphaCertified. Examples are presented to demonstrate this certification algorithm.},

To do so, we exploit natural incidence structures on the fibers of several maps to reduce all questions to statements about the Prym map for genus six curves. This allows us to find all components of the big Schottky locus and thus, to show that the small Schottky locus introduced by Donagi is irreducible.},

Now a part of SIAM's Classics series, these volumes contain a large number of concrete, interesting examples of boundary value problems for partial differential equations that cover a variety of applications that are still relevant today. For example, there is substantial treatment of the Helmholtz equation and scattering theory--subjects that play a central role in contemporary inverse problems in acoustics and electromagnetic theory.},

abstract = {Novikov's conjecture on the Riemann-Schottky problem: {\it the Jacobians of smooth algebraic curves are precisely those indecomposable principally polarized abelian varieties (ppavs) whose theta-functions provide solutions to the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation}, was the first evidence of nowadays well-established fact: connections between the algebraic geometry and the modern theory of integrable systems is beneficial for both sides. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Our first goal is to present a proof of the strongest known characterization of a Jacobian variety in this direction: {\it an indecomposable ppav $X$ is the Jacobian of a curve if and only if its Kummer variety $K(X)$ has a trisecant line} and the solution of the characterization problem of principally polarized Prym varieties. The latter problem is almost as old and famous as the Riemann-Schottky problem but is much harder. In some sense the Prym varieties may be geometrically the easiest-to-understand ppavs beyond Jacobians, and studying them may be a first step towards understanding the geometry of more general abelian varieties as well. Our second and primary objective is to take this opportunity to elaborate on motivations underlining the proposed solution of the Riemann-Schottky problem, to introduce a certain circle of ideas and methods, developed in the theory of soliton equations, and to convince the reader that they are algebro-geometric in nature, simple and universal enough to be included in the Handbook of moduli.},

abstract = {The aim of these lecture notes is to update Beauville's beau- tiful 1987 S ÃÅeminaire Bourbaki talk on the same subject. The Schottky problem is the problem of finding characterizations of Jacobians among all principally polarized abelian varieties. We review the numerous approaches to this problem. In the ``analytical approach'', one tries to find polynomials in the thetaconstants that define the Jacobian locus in the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties. We review van Geemen's (1984) and Donagi's (1987) work in that direction. The loci they get contain the Jacobian locus as an irreducible component. In the ``geometrical ap- proach'', one tries to give geometric properties that are satisfied only by Jacobians. We review the following: singularities of the theta divisor (An- dreotti and Mayer 1967); reducibility of intersections of a theta divisor with a translate (Welters 1984) and trisecants to the Kummer variety (Welters 1983, Beauville and Debarre 1986, Debarre 1992); the K--P equation and Novikov's conjecture (Shiota 1986, Arbarello and De Concini 1984); double translation hypersurfaces (Little 1989); the van Geemen--van der Geer con- jectures on the base locus of the set of second order theta functions that vanish with multiplicity ‚â• 4 at the origin (Beauville and Debarre 1989, Izadi 1993); subvarieties with minimal class (Ran 1981, Debarre 1992); the Buser--Sarnak approach (1993).},

Now a part of SIAM's Classics series, these volumes contain a large number of concrete, interesting examples of boundary value problems for partial differential equations that cover a variety of applications that are still relevant today. For example, there is substantial treatment of the Helmholtz equation and scattering theory--subjects that play a central role in contemporary inverse problems in acoustics and electromagnetic theory.},

Consequently, the effect of surface tension on gravity-capillary flows continues to be a fertile field of research in applied mathematics and engineering. Concentrating on applications arising from fluid dynamics, Vanden-Broeck draws upon his years of experience in the field to address the many challenges involved in attempting to describe such flows mathematically. Whilst careful numerical techniques are implemented to solve the basic equations, an emphasis is placed upon the reader developing a deep understanding of the structure of the resulting solutions. The author also reviews relevant concepts in fluid mechanics to help readers from other scientific fields who are interested in free boundary problems.},
